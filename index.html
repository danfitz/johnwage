        Hi all!
        <br><br>
        For my birthday this year (Dec 13th), if you were intending on giving me a gift, please instead donate to my charity of choice this year:
        <br><br>
        <img id="giveDirectlyLogo" src="images/GiveDirectly%20logo.png">
        <br>
        GiveDirectly transfers cash to poor households in low-income countries primarily via mobile phone-linked payment services. It has operated since 2009 and is currently active in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda (launched in October 2016).
        <br><br>
        I truly don’t need any money or gifts this year.  I have plenty.  Your dollar will have a much greater impact with GiveDirectly than with me.
        <br><br>
        <strong>It would make me really happy if for my birthday someone’s quality of life went up.  You could offer them and their family more choice, more hope, and hopefully more opportunity.
        <br><br>
        You don’t need to tell me how much you donated. I’ll know you donated by clicking the link below:</strong>
        <br>

          <input id="gdName" type="text" name="name" placeholder="What is your name? :)" required>
          <button id="gdButton" type="submit">Go to <span style="font-family: 'Lato' !important; font-size: 15px;">GiveDirectly.org</span></button>
        </form>
        Thank you for the birthday gift, and sorry for this last minute post!
        <br><br>
        Love always,
        <br>

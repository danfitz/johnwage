        <span style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', sans-serif; align-self: start; font-size: 40px;">Hi all!</span>
        <p style="align-self: start;">For my birthday this year (Dec 13th), if you were intending on giving me a gift, please instead donate to my charity of choice this year:</p>
        <img id="giveDirectlyLogo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielfitz/johnwage/master/images/GiveDirectly%20logo.png">
        <p style="align-self: start;">GiveDirectly transfers cash to poor households in low-income countries primarily via mobile phone-linked payment services. It has operated since 2009 and is currently active in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda (launched in October 2016).</p>
        <p style="align-self: start;">I truly don’t need any money or gifts this year.  I have plenty.  Your dollar will have a much greater impact with GiveDirectly than with me.</p>
        <p style="align-self: start; font-weight: 700;">It would make me really happy if for my birthday someone’s quality of life went up.  You could offer them and their family more choice, more hope, and hopefully more opportunity.</p>
        <p style="align-self: start; font-weight: 700;">You don’t need to tell me how much you donated. I’ll know you donated by clicking the link below:</p>
        <form id="gdForm" action="https://formspree.io/john.m.wage@gmail.com" method="POST">
          <input id="gdName" type="text" name="name" placeholder="What is your name? :)" required>
          <button id="gdButton" type="submit">
            Go to <span style="font-family: 'Lato' !important; font-size: 15px;">GiveDirectly.org</span>
          </button>
          <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://GiveDirectly.org">
        </form>
        <p style="align-self: start;">Thank you for the birthday gift, and sorry for this last minute post!</p>
        <p style="align-self: start;">Love always,</p>
        <span style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', sans-serif; align-self: start; font-size: 40px;">John</span>

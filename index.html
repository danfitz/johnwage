        <p style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', sans-serif; font-size: 30px;">Hi all!</p>
        <p>For my birthday (Dec 13th), please consider donating to my charity of choice for this year:</p>
        <img id="giveDirectlyLogo" src="images/GiveDirectly%20logo.png">
        <p>It would make me really happy if for my birthday someone’s quality of life went up.  You could offer them and their family more choice, more hope, and hopefully more opportunity.</p>
        <p>You don’t need to tell me how much you donated. (But you can send me a screenshot if you'd like!)</p>

        <p>GiveDirectly transfers cash to poor households in low-income countries primarily via mobile phone-linked payment services. It has operated since 2009 and is currently active in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda.</p>
        <p>I truly don’t need any money or gifts this year. Your dollar will have a much greater impact with GiveDirectly than with me!</p>
